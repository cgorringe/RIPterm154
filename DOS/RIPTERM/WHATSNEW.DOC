                  Version 1.54.00 ... Released 7/15/93                      
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸

     Fixed a bug that appeared only when upgrading to a new copy
      of RIPterm.  In previous versions, the modem initialization
      string, baud rate and other comm parameters would be reset
      to "stock" RIPterm settings.  In other words, whatever
      comm settings you had setup in your older version of RIPterm
      would be forgotten and overwritten with some "defaults"
      that RIPterm thought were more appropriate.  This no longer
      happens and RIPterm will preserve your older configuration.

     Fixed a couple of glitches with Mouse Buttons that use the
      Hot Icon mode of the RIP_BUTTON command.  In prior versions,
      the Hot Icon wasn't properly displayed without the INVERT
      flag present.  Now it does.  Also, when INVERT is enabled,
      the button's label would be inverted as it should be but
      when INVERT was not present, the labels were still being
      inverted when they shouldn't have been.  Now corrected.
      Also corrected in this bug fix were some other minor
      glitches relating to radio buttons and checkbox buttons
      when they were used without the INVERT flag being present.
      In all cases, a radio button or checkbox button must have
      some kind of way of inverting the button or presenting
      an alternative image of the button.  Now, if a button is
      a radio button or a checkbox button, then INVERT is assumed
      unless it is a hot icon button where the alternate icon is
      used for the selected button image.

     Fixed a bug where BBS sub-directories weren't automatically
      created upon dialing the system the first time.  This only
      happened under certain situations, depending on the type of
      modem you owned.  

     Cleaned up some timing problems with Zmodem and Ymodem (batch)
      uploads and downloads.  We have been working closely with the
      authors of the File Transfer Protocol routines and think that
      we now have a very stable set of transfer protocols.  Sorry
      about the past instabilities.

     Fixed a couple of bugs with the remote definition of text variables.
      One of the bugs would always put a question mark in the data field
      when asking you to fill-in a text variable.  Another bug would
      corrupt the dialog box when the question was entirely blank.  Both
      are now fixed.

     Added support for a new RIPscrip command: Poly-Line

     Supported the full modes of the RIP_VIEWPORT command for defining
      graphical display viewports for RIPscrip graphics primitives.

     Corrected a bug with RIPterm's ASCII Upload feature.  In previous
      versions, ASCII upload didn't look for its upload files in the
      Upload Directory - they were always assumed to be in the current
      directory.  This is no longer the case and ASCII uploads operate
      as you would expect them to - looking up files in the appropriate
      upload directory.

     Fixed a one-pixel glitch on the download window where one of
      the fields was off by a pixel.  It annoyed me, ok!

     Fixed a bug with the Scrolling Popup Menu routines.  Under some
      circumstances, these operations could cause RIPterm to freak out
      and the mouse to move around all-by-itself and do weird things.
      Turned out to be a low-level problem with one of the graphics
      routines that drew the popup menu.  This bug also existed in
      RIPaint and was fixed simultaneously.

     Improved the appearance of the Pull Down menus a bit with a tad
      more beveling <grin>.

     Fixed a problem where if you accessed the pull-down menu by the
      keyboard (ie, F10=menu) and you choose an option like the Dialing
      Directory, Hangup, Download File, etc., RIPterm will no longer
      return to the Pull Down menu immediately upon completion of the
      command.  This was best exemplified with the Dialing Directory.
      If you got a connection, you would be popped back into the pull
      down menu and wouldn't see anything.  You would have to hit the
      ESCAPE key twice to get out of the menus before you would see 
      any of the text from the Host.  This is now no longer the case.

     Fixed a problem when RIPterm senses the Fonts or Icon Files are
      in the wrong directory, where RIPterm would not preserve the
      correct file date/time on the newly copied file(s).  This could
      affect the RIP_FILE_QUERY command where the BBS can ask RIPterm
      if it has a certain file, and if so, what the date/time of the
      file is.  Since the date/time was incorrect on the file, it could
      frequently be unneccessarily downloaded from the Host.

     The RIPscrip Auto-Sensing command contains a Vendor Code indicating
      which Manufacturer's terminal is responding.  The valid Vendor
      codes are:

               0 - Generic RIPscrip terminal (manufacturer unknown)
               1 - RIPterm (from TeleGrafix Communications, Inc.)
               2 - Qmodem Pro (from Mustang Software, Inc.)

      These codes are contained in the return string sent to the Host
      when RIPterm detects an version number query command.  The format
      of the return string is:  RIPSCRIP0153xy where "x" is the Vendor
      Code (0-2) and the "y" is the manufacturer's version code.  The
      "0153" indicates the version number of the RIPscrip specification
      without decimal points (eg, v1.53 would be 0153).  In v1.53.00 of
      RIPterm, the software was incorrectly responding as Vendor Code
      #2 (same as Qmodem Pro).  This is now corrected to the proper value
      of "1". (eg, RIPSCRIP015311) where our Revision Code is "1" and our
      Vendor Code is "1".

     Resolved a bug with the external Font Files (.CHR files).  When the
      User unZIP's RIPterm, the Icon and Font files could be placed in
      the incorrect location if the user didn't extract the archive with
      sub-directory information.  When this happens, RIPterm would ask
      the user if he wants to move the files to the proper directories.
      The Icon Files (.ICN, .HIC and .MSK files) are moved to the ICONS\
      directory and the .CHR files should be moved to the FONTS\ directory.
      The Bug that existed in the last release tried to move the .CHR
      files over to the FONTS\ directory BEFORE the directory was created.
      The second time you ran RIPterm, the directory would exist and the
      files would be moved over properly.

     Resolved a glitch with the Upload/Download directories.  If you did
      not place a backslash on the end of the path, RIPterm would not
      properly store the files that you downloaded.  In fact, the files
      would disappear as if by magic.  RIPterm now automatically places
      a backslash on the end for you and even capitalizes the path for you.
      Isn't technology wonderful?

     Fixed a minor bug with the RIP_ENTER_BLOCK_MODE command where if
      you actually attempt to do a batch file transfer (more than one file)
      the progress meter at the bottom of the Block Transfer window would
      not get cleared from one file to the next (ie, Reset).

     Enhanced the operation of the Button Command when used with Radio
      Buttons or Checkbox Groups and when the button is initially drawn
      as "selected".  In previous versions, any Host Command string was
      not automatically processed.  Due to popular demand, it is processed
      immediately (and possibly transmitted to the Host).

     Fixed a bug with the RIP_DEFINE command.  If the text variable to
      be defined was flagged to be saved to the database, it would not;
      it was saved to an internal "volatile" memory table which only
      exists until RIPterm exits.  If you tried to define a text variable
      and tell it NOT to save to the database (putting it in the table
      intentionally), then it WOULD get saved to the database.  This
      obviously backwards way of doing things is now rectified and the
      variables will be saved to either the database or the internal
      memory table as they should.

     Fixed another bug with RIPscrip processing - If a CTRL-A or CTRL-B
      was received, RIPterm would attempt to process it as a RIPscrip
      command.  Even if the following character wasn't a vertical bar (|)
      then the CTRL-A or CTRL-B would get gobbled (not displayed) and
      the next character would get ignored.  Now, the CTRL-A or CTRL-B
      are displayed as well as the second character.

                  Version 1.53.00 ... Released 6/3/93                       
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸

     Fixed a bug with Mouse Buttons that would (when clicked) mess
      up the sunken attribute by extending the bevel one pixel wider
      in all directions (inward).  This had the net effect that when
      you click on a Mouse Button, its bevel would get thicker and
      would thus not appear the way it should when you release the
      mouse on the button (release).

     Resolved a bug with the $RTW$ text variable where the Text Window
      WRAP/CHOP setting wasn't being preserved when you do a Restore
      Text Window command.

     If RIPterm senses that it is upgraded to a newer version, the
      first time that RIPterm loads it will display the "About Box"
      to inform you of any alterations in the software (if any).

     The file transfer protocols now yield an alarm sound in the
      event of a transfer error - in addition to a pop-up message
      window.  This gives you an audible clue that something went
      wrong.

     Added the ability to disable all alarm sounds and other various
      forms of beeping and general noise.  You can now make RIPterm
      completely silent if you wish by turning OFF Alarm Sounds and
      Disabling Beeps.

     Altered the hangup code so that if a hangup operation fails,
      not only will it display "Hangup Failed", but it will also
      beep your terminal to indicate some kind of error occured.

     Fixed the RIPTERM.FNT file to display the proper characters
      for ASCII characters 9, 10 and 13.  In prior versions of
      RIPterm, these characters appeared as blank spaces.  In this
      version, they appear as a circle, reversed circle and a 
      single-stem musical note.

     Resolved a bug where a vertical bar (|) occuring in a text
      portion of a RIPscrip sequence (even if it was preceded with
      a backslash escaping character), the remainder of the line of
      RIP code would be "discarded" as illegal RIPscrip code, and
      the last portion of the text parameter would be discarded.

     Improved the look & feel of a number of the pop-up window boxes
      in RIPterm.

     Added a "Expand Blank Line" option to the ASCII File Upload
      Settings dialog box.  If enabled (the default), any blank lines
      that are ASCII uploaded will be expanded to a space<cr> so that
      things like Email Editors and things won't interpret the data
      as a blank line (and re-prompt the user with a command prompt).
      In some cases however, this is undesirable; in cases like these,
      simply turn this option off and no space padding will be added
      on blank lines.

     Re-designed the Modem Options dialog box.  Many options in there
      now adhere to the "pop-down" menu concept for the COM Port, Baud,
      Data Bits, Parity and Stop Bits settings making the dialog box
      a lot less clutterd and much easier to work with and understand.
     
     Modified the RIP_ENTER_BLOCK mode.  The format of the RIPscrip
      command used to be:

          !|9<escape> protocol:2 filetype:2 reserved:2 [filename] <>

      The block mode was modified to allow for both downloads and now
      automated uploading.  The protocol field was previously a 2-digit
      MegaNum parameter.  It is now a 1-digit MegaNum parameter, and
      a mode field (1 digit) was added in front of the protocol field
      as in the following syntax:

          !|9<escape> mode:1 protocol:1 filetype:2 reserved:2 [filename] <>

      A mode value of 0 indicates download block mode.  A value of 1
      indicates an upload.  When in upload mode, the filename field IS
      required, and multiple files can be specified if the protocol
      field indicates a batch type protocol.

      If Data Security in RIPterm is enabled and an "upload" type block
      request is received, RIPterm will prompt the user if he wishes
      to approve the upload.  If the user denies the upload, RIPterm
      will send 10 CAN characters to the host separated by 1/10th
      second pauses to abort any file transfer protocol that may be
      active on the host end.

     Added six new graphical fonts to RIPterm.  The new fonts, and
      their font-id numbers are as follows:

          05 - Script Font
          06 - Simplex Font
          07 - Triplex Script Font
          08 - Complex Font
          09 - European Font
          0A - Bold Font (outline font)

      These font-id numbers can be used in conjunction with the
      RIP_FONT_STYLE command to set different graphical fonts in RIPscrip.

     Externalized the RIPterm graphical fonts.  All fonts are contained
      in external disk-based font files.  This serves three purposes:

          1) All fonts are now easily editable with any available
             Borland BGI font editor.
          2) RIPterm now requires approximately 40k less memory to
             operate, since the fonts are no longer embedded into
             the RIPTERM.EXE file.
          3) It makes the addition of more fonts easier in the future.

     Added upload and download sub-directory support.  All files that
      are uploaded will be searched for in the designated upload
      directory, and the same applies for downloads with the download
      directory.  If no directory has been specified, then uploads and
      downloads will be directed to the current sub-directory that
      RIPterm is using (unless otherwise specified).

     Modified the dialing directory so that it clears the screen
      before dialing a system, thus removing any log-off screens
      from previously called systems that might still be on the
      screen (leaving RIPterm in a "fresh" state for the next BBS).

     Fixed "Icon Sub-directories" with Mouse Buttons that use
      Icon Files for the button image.  In previous versions, 
      if the desired Icon file wasn't in the ICONS\ sub-directory,
      it wouldn't be loaded for the button image and consequently,
      the button wouldn't be created (ie, no clickable button).

     Added an option to lower DTR upon exit of RIPterm.  Normally,
      RIPterm would leave DTR enabled when RIPterm exits, or when
      changing to another COM port.  This new option will lower
      DTR when a COM port is closed or when RIPterm exits, provided
      you are not already online and indicate to RIPterm not to hangup.
      If you instruct RIPterm not to hangup, DTR will remain active
      (high).

     Added enhanced Doorway (tm) support.  RIPterm's Doorway mode has
      been significantly enhanced to support the advanced features of
      Printer Re-direction and Special Character Overides.  In addition,
      the ANSI sequences to enable/disable Doorway mode are supported
      along with the ANSI sequences to print strings.  If a printer
      is not configured, RIPterm will instruct Doorway that it does
      not support printer re-direction.  RIPterm should be fully
      100% doorway compatible in all modes.  As a point worth mentioning,
      RIPterm v1.53 is the first commercial terminal program to ever
      support the full Doorway interface totally!

     Added Session Logging to the Printer.  You may now toggle the
      printer ON via ALT-P and any ASCII/ANSI text that appears over
      the modem will be printed as well as displayed on the user's
      screen.  When session printing is enabled, a field on the
      status line changes to reflect that printing is active.
      Clicking on this field will toggle the printer off.

     You can now specify which LPT port your printer is connected
      to in the General Setup dialog box.  You may choose from LPT1
      through LPT3 or set it to 0 for no printer attached.  If you
      specify not to use a printer, choosing any Print options from
      within RIPterm will instruct you that there is no printer
      attached and will refuse to attempt printing.

     Text parameters of RIPscrip commands may now be up to 1024 bytes
      in length instead of the previous 256 byte limit.

     A bug existed in previous version of RIPterm that would prevent
      a line of text from being displayed if an exclamation point (!)
      appeared in column #1.

     Modified the Enter Block Transfer mode to change the RIPscrip
      command level to 9 instead of 10.  This was done for technical
      reasons and has been adopted into the RIPscrip Protocol
      Specification.  For the time being, RIPterm will recognize the
      level-10 flavor of the Enter Block Transfer mode as well as the
      level-9 version.  The level-10 variety was left in for 
      compatibility reasons and will be phased out in a future release.
      Level-10 commands have been entirely eliminated in the RIPscrip
      specification.

     Made it so that if Data Security is enabled, whenever you try
      to run an application via its text variable name, you are
      prompted if you truly wish to run the application.  If Data
      Security is disabled, the application will execute immediately.

     The VT-100 Character Set functions (G0 and G1) were not being
      reset when the user manually cleared his screen.  They do now.

     14 new text variables have been added bringing RIPterm up to
      a grand total of 103 built-in text variables.  The new text
      variables are:

             TWH ... Current text window's height
             TWW ... Current text window's width
            TWX0 ... Upper-left  X coordinate of text window
            TWY0 ... Upper-left  Y coordinate of text window
            TWX1 ... Lower-right X coordinate of text window
            TWY1 ... Lower-right Y coordinate of text window
           TWWIN ... Returns YES if text window active, otherwise NO
          TWFONT ... Current System Font number in use or 0 for none
            CURX ... Returns the current X cursor coordinate
            CURY ... Returns the current Y cursor coordinate
          CURSOR ... Returns YES if the cursor is visible, otherwise NO
         SAVEALL ... Performs the following: SAVE STW SCB and SMF
      RESTOREALL ... Performs the following: RESTORE RTW RCB and RMF
           RESET ... Resets the screen (like ALT-R in RIPterm)
           ALARM ... An alarm sound - same as aborted file transfers
          PHASER ... A descending frequency phaser-like sound
       REVPHASER ... The same as PHASER except it is the reverse sound

     All ANSI sequences supported by RIPterm are now documented in
      Appendix B of the RIPTERM.DOC file for reference purposes.

     Modified Kermit file transfers so that if you perform an upload
      operation of a binary file over a 7-bit connection, the file
      will transfer correctly.  In prior versions, the file would
      become garbled due to the nature of the connection.

     Repaired the incompatibilities with Custom Color Palettes on
      particular hardware combinations.  Under some circumstances,
      RIPterm would freak out the video system whenever a custom
      color palette was encountered.

     Added a feature to the file transfer protocols such that
      if a file by the same name already exists, it will manipulate
      the filename such that it doesn't overwrite the previously
      saved file.  For example, TEST.TXT might be converted to
      TEST.TX0, TEST.TX1, all the way up to TEST.999 for the 1000th
      download of TEST.TXT.  If Zmodem Crash Recovery is enabled,
      then this option will not apply when using Zmodem.  If 
      Crash Recovery is disabled, then Zmodem will utilize this
      feature.

     Added a new option - Zmodem Recovery which controls whether
      Zmodem should utilize Crash Recovery or not.  This is part
      of your RIPterm setup.

     Enhanced the External Application function, allowing a
      particular application entry to be linked to a particular
      file extension.  With this, you can automatically fire off
      an application whenever a file with the appropriate file
      extension is downloaded!  Viewing .GIF files the moment they
      are downloaded is but one application of this feature.

     Modified the Printer Output routines so that when text is
      printed, both a carriage return and a line feed would be
      output to the printer, not just a line feed.  On printers
      like Epsons, this didn't seem to be a big deal, but on
      most popular Laser Printers, it is a problem [was].

     Significantly re-structured the pull-down menus to be easier
      to understand and to find things.

     Added a General Setup dialog box which allows you to edit
      many setup-related options in RIPterm from one central location.
      No more having to set a bunch of options in the pull-down
      menus.

     Enhanced the DOS Shell function.  DOS shells will now swap 
      nearly 100% of all RIPterm data out of conventional (640k) 
      memory into either EMS, XMS or to disk if all else fails.
      RIPterm will only leave a 5.5k footprint in conventional
      memory giving you nearly all of your memory back to MS-DOS
      when you shell.  While you are shelled to DOS, RIPterm will
      ignore any incoming data over the modem.

     Added an External pull-down menu.  You may install local
      applications from within this menu which you can then
      execute quickly and easily from within RIPterm.

     Added ten new text variables:  $APP0$ through $APP9$.  These
      variables will execute applications #0 - 9.  You can use this
      from within keystroke macros or from within Host Commands to
      fire off a local DOS application while still online.

     Modified the file transfer protocols so that they intelligently
      handle Carrier Detect.  In prior versions, if CD was low, the
      file protocols would think that the connection was lost and it
      would abort the transfer.  Now, if CD is high before the
      transfer starts, it will monitor carrier to check for a lost
      connection.  If CD is low before the transfer begins, then 
      RIPterm will ignore the status of Carrier Detect throughout
      the duration of the transfer.

     If RIPterm was out of memory, initiating a file transfer
      would result in an aborted transfer due to lack of memory.
      This should no longer happen.

     Modified the file transfer routines so that if all memory in
      RIPterm is exhausted, a file upload/download will no longer 
      abort from lack of memory.  To gain the necessary memory
      (approximately 1.5k), RIPterm will discard the oldest lines
      of text in the scrollback buffer until the memory request
      can be satisfied.

     Altered the About Box for RIPterm.  The About Box now is
      physically part of the RIPTERM.EXE file rather than the
      Help system.

                 Version 1.52.00 ... Released 04/20/93                      
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸

     Added Dialing Prefix and Suffixes.  You may now have three
      separate Dialing Prefixes and three separate Dialing Suffixes
      to choose from for different telephone environments.

     Altered to Dialing Directory Editor.  All fields are now pop-up
      data fields instead of a lot of tiny radio buttons which are
      more confusing looking.  Also added support for dialing prefix
      and suffix in the editor.

     Enhanced the look and feel of all pop-up menus, pull-down menus,
      dialing window and the file transfer windows.  Much more 
      professional looking.

     Changed some of the low-level file I/O code in RIPterm to some
      faster routines.  Icons should display faster (a bit) and windows,
      when closed, should appear a little faster.

     Redesigned RIPterm's internal memory structure.  By first
      appearance, it will seem that RIPterm requires more memory than
      it used to.  However, after prolonged use of RIPterm in the
      same session, you will find that it no longer runs out of memory
      as often, or freak out when memory runs low.  These problems
      were due to Memory Fragmentation errors.

     Fixed a bug with the scrollback buffer that would blank out the
      bottom line of the window when you hit the UP-ARROW key to scroll
      up.

     Resolved a number of functional problems with the low-level
      communications system of RIPterm.  Characters were being lost
      with high speed modems with RTS/CTS enabled.  This should now
      be resolved for you high-speed modem junkies.

     Zmodem file transfers were having timing difficulties.  Now
      resolved.  You should notice Zmodem uploads work excellent
      now and Zmodem downloads are also much more reliable.

     Fixed a number of bugs with VT-100/ANSI cursor positioning
      with regard to the VT-100 vertical scrolling margins.  Also,
      some glitches existed when the status bar was on/off that
      didn't appear in prior releases.

     RIPterm now auto-senses if you are using it on a MicroChannel
      machine, and if so auto-patches the I/O Addresses and the
      IRQ values for COM3-4 which are different.

     The RIPTERM.FNT file is now considerably smaller (about 1/4 its
      original size).

     Fixed the bug which freaked out RIPterm when you execute the
      "Built-in variables" option from the DATA pull-down menu.

     The options that list out the text variables did not display
      properly unless CR/LF was enabled.  This is now corrected and
      they should display properly regardless of your CR/LF setting.

     RIPterm will now restore the setting of the Scroll-Lock key
      when it exits to DOS.  The status of the key is reset to
      whatever the setting was when RIPterm booted up.

     Added a visual error recovery notation on the progress bar of
      the file transfer window.  You can now visually see how far
      the protocol had to "back up".

     Added four new text variables:

        $HKEYON$ ... Enable Button Hotkeys

        This option enables button hotkeys.  Any Button that is
        created by a BBS that has a hotkey will be activated
        if you hit the corresponding key on your keyboard. 
        This will light-up the Scroll-Lock key on your
        keyboard indicating that Button Hotkey mode is ON.


        $HKEYOFF$ ... Disable Button Hotkeys

        This option disables button hotkeys.  Any Button that
        is created by a BBS that has a hotkey associated with
        it, will not be activated even if the user hits that
        key on his keyboard.  The only way to activate a
        button in this mode is with the mouse.  The
        Scroll-Lock key on your keyboard will go dim,
        indicating that Button Hotkey Mode is disabled.


        $TABON$ ... Enable TAB to execute mouse fields

        When this variable is processed, you can use the TAB
        key to navigate through the Mouse/Button fields on
        your screen.  In this mode, you can access the fields
        without a mouse.  The side- effect is that the TAB key
        cannot be used directly with the Host.


        $TABOFF$ ... Disable TAB to execute mouse fields

        When this variable is processed, you cannot use the TAB
        key to navigate throug the Mouse/Button fields on your
        screen.  In this mode, whenever the TAB key is hit, it
        is sent directly to the Host as a TAB character.  Any
        fields that are already hilighted when this variable
        is received will be de-hilighted.
        

     Tech Note: The Clipboard is now auto-allocated upon RIPterm bootup
      to a fixed size of 64k.  If you load an Icon but instruct RIPterm
      not to put it on the clipboard, it will still load even if the
      icon is up to 64k in size.

                 Version 1.51.00 ... Released 03/29/93                      
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸

     VT-102 compatible operation.  RIPterm now adheres to ANSI SCO/UNIX
      VT-102 compatibility.

     Bugs were fixed with VT-102 tab stops and tab handling

     In VT-102 mode, backspaces are now non-destructive.

     Added several VT-102 commands:
    
               ESC [ <n> @  ..... Insert <n> characters
               ESC [ <n> P  ..... Delete <n> characters
               ESC [ <n> L  ..... Insert <n> lines
               ESC [ <n> M  ..... Delete <n> lines
               ESC [ <n> Z  ..... Move cursor backward <n> tab stops

     Fixed a number of bugs with ANSI clear-screen/area commands.

     ANSI clear screen (ESC [ 2 J) commands now properly reset the screen
      to the proper display attribute.

     Scrolling the screen will clear the bottom line to the proper display
      attributes.

     Supports VT-102 character sets G0 and G1 (US, UK or Special Sets)

     A couple of bugs were fixed in this version pertaining to one-line
      text windows.  Two oddities were happening when in this mode:

          1) when the window "scrolls", portions of the previous
             line would remain at the top of the text window, and
          2) if the window was set to "CHOP" mode (i.e., NO WRAP),
             and you hit the far-right of the window, characters
             that you type would appear outside the text window
             off to the right (potentially disturbing graphics).

     Another bug was fixed with the 80x43 and 91x43 fonts with the
      status bar.  If the status bar is OFF and the cursor is underneath
      where the status bar would normally be, and then the status bar
      is enabled, the status bar would be disturbed by the cursor or
      the text.  In other words, the status bar would get freaked out.

     More sophisticated Save Screen and Restore Screen macros were
      added in this version.  There are now text variables for
      $SAVE0$ - $SAVE9$ and $RESTORE0$ - $RESTORE9$.  This gives you
      ten different simultaneously saved graphics screens.  When you
      restore one of these screens using RESTORE0-9, the temporary
      files are immediately deleted when restored.  This is different
      than the $RESTORE$ variable which leaves the screen file on the
      hard disk even after the restoration is complete.  This allows
      for multiple restores to occur without having to re-save the
      screen each time.  The SAVE0 through SAVE9 commands save their
      graphical data to files RIPTERM0.SAV through RIPTERM9.SAV.

     When RIPterm boots up and shuts down, it will delete any
      temporary files created by the text variable commands.  The
      files that will be removed are:

               RIPFIELD.SAV ... Saved Mouse Fields
               SCRAPBUF.SAV ... Saved Clipboard
               RIPTERM.SAV  ... Saved graphics screen ($SAVE$)
               RIPTERM0.SAV ... Saved graphics screen ($SAVE0$)
                    :                        :
               RIPTERM9.SAV ... Saved graphics screen ($SAVE9$)

     A new option is available to the RIPterm user: Button hotkey
      release mode.  This allows the user to determine whether his
      keystrokes should be checked with the BBS buttons or not for
      activation.  In other words, if the BBS places a button on
      the screen like this:

                      旼컴컴컴컴컴컴컴커
                                      
                        (E)nter name  
                                      
                      읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸

      ...where the hotkey for the button is "E", simply pressing the
      "E" key on your keyboard would normally activate this button.
      This may not be desirable if you're trying to send a message to
      another user with the letter "E" in it.  Now, there's a way
      around this: Hotkey Release Mode.

      Hotkey Release mode is linked to your SCROLL-LOCK key on your
      keyboard.  If Scroll Lock is lit, then hotkeys are processed.
      If it is not lit, then the character will be sent to the BBS
      directly, bypassing any button hotkeys.  If you set this option
      from within the pull-down menus, then the option can be
      permanently saved to the RIPterm setup.  Simply toggling the
      option with the Scroll Lock key directly will not be automatically
      saved to your setup (even if you perform a "Save Setup").

     When you initially install RIPterm, and if a dialing directory
      file is present, RIPterm will scan the file and make sure that
      all of the entries in it are set to the proper COM port that
      you specified when you originally installed RIPterm.  Also, the
      Baud Rate will be set appropriately.

     When running RIPterm for the first time, entering a "0" for the
      COM port (presumably to return to DOS) no longer reboots your
      PC (whoops).  This also applies to the Baud Rate installation
      option.

     Fixed a bug where the Numeric Keypad would not produce numeric
      digits in the normal terminal window.  This bug was fixed a long
      time ago but in some internal restructuring of RIPterm, it managed
      to creep back into the software.  Sorry folks.

     Added a new feature into one of the RIPscrip commands allowing
      the Host to ask the terminal to inform it when the user clicks
      the mouse somewhere on the screen.  This could be greatly used
      by software manufacturers who wish to make interactive programs
      like Games or other such things that take advantage of the Mouse
      remotely.  Imagine playing a space game with your ship in the
      middle of the screen, and clicking elsewhere in the space-map
      and having your ship turn and head toward where you click!
      For the technical minded, these changes were made to the RIP_QUERY
      command.  Two new flags were added to this:

          1) Tell the Host if the user clicks in the graphics window
          2) Tell the Host if the user clicks in the text window

     This version corrects a problem with "local RIP file playback"
      options.  In prior versions, this mode would slowly gobble up
      file handles until there are none left.  At that point, subsequent
      Playback was not possible unless you exit RIPterm and re-run it.
      
     Resolved a bug where Local RIP playback was not functioning
      properly when used in a Mouse or Button Host Command.

     Cleared up a bug with Full/Duplex toggling.  When you toggled
      this option ON or OFF, the status bar was not properly updated.

     Added a number of new text variables:

           $VT102ON$ ... Turn VT-102 mode ON
          $VT102OFF$ ... Turn VT-102 mode OFF
            $DWAYON$ ... Turn Doorway Mode ON
           $DWAYOFF$ ... Turn Doorway Mode OFF
               $STW$ ... Saves text window layout
               $RTW$ ... Restores text window layout
              $COFF$ ... Disable text cursor
               $CON$ ... Enable (display) text cursor
               $STW$ ... Saves the text window information
               $RTW$ ... Restores text window orientation

     Added two new text variables: $SAVE$ and $RESTORE$.  The SAVE
      variable will completely save the contents of the entire graphics
      screen to a disk file called RIPTERM.SAV.  No Mouse Fields, Text
      Window locations or Clipboard data are saved - just the graphics
      screen.  The entire 640x350 region is saved to disk.  The RESTORE
      command will read the saved file in from disk and restore the
      graphics as they were originally saved.  If you wish to save the
      entire state of the RIPterm system, use the following text variables
      all at the same time (spaces are added for clarity):

              $SAVE$ $STW$ $SCB$ $SMF$
                 \     \     \     \
                  \     \     \     --- Save Mouse Fields
                   \     \     \
                    \     \     ------- Save ClipBoard
                     \     \
                      \     ----------- Save Text Window
                       \
                        --------------- Save Graphics Screen

      And to restore the entire context of a graphics environment, use
      the following text variables:

              $RESTORE$ $STW$ $SCB$ $SMF$
                 \        \     \     \
                  \        \     \     --- Restore Mouse Fields
                   \        \     \
                    \        \     ------- Restore ClipBoard
                     \        \
                      \        ----------- Restore Text Window
                       \
                        ------------------ Restore Graphics Screen

     Text output speed has been vastly improved.  This only pertains to
      text that is viewed in the Text Window (i.e., ASCII and ANSI text
      that comes from the BBS, not graphical text messages in various
      fonts).  In raw performance benchmarks we have determined some
      statistics for these new printing routines.  In a test conducted
      of 100,000 characters being printed (without any scrolling),
      RIPterm consistently outperformed the old printing method by
      the following times:

           Font     New Time       Old Time       Speed Ratio
          -------------------------------------------------------
          80x43      5 seconds     32 seconds      6.40 to 1
          80x25      7 seconds     53 seconds      7.57 to 1
          91x43     18 seconds     42 seconds      2.33 to 1
          91x25     27 seconds     69 seconds      2.56 to 1
          40x25     12 seconds     78 seconds      6.50 to 1
                                         ===================
                                         AVERAGE:  5.07 to 1

     New "Port Baud Lock" feature.  This option, available from the
      Modem Options dialog box allows you to "lock" that baud rate
      that the modem will use to whatever is defined in your Setup
      (or in your dialing directory entries).  Even if the modem
      connects with a "CONNECT xxxx" where "xxxx" is lower than this
      "locked" baud rate, RIPterm will not adjust its baud rate
      downward.  The reason for this is many high speed modems with
      MNP or v.42 bis compression schemes require that the modem-to-
      computer baud rate be higher than the actual connection speed.
      Some modems will indicate the connection speed between the
      two modems, and others will return the speed between the modem
      and the PC.  If you have a normal 2400 baud modem, you will
      not need to activate this option.  This option is only of
      use if you have a high speed, error correcting or data compressing
      modem.

         NOTE: This option is part of the RIPterm setup.

     Dialing the modem now takes special care of the Carrier Detect
      signal.  If the CD signal is low (indicating no connection),
      then if the CD signal goes high during the dialing process,
      RIPterm will announce a successful connection and switch to
      the Terminal screen.  If the CD signal is high when dialing
      occurs, its status is ignored for the duration of the dialing
      process and RIPterm will wait only for a CONNECT XXXX, BUSY,
      VOICE, NO DIALTONE or ERROR messages.  This added intelligence
      should aid RIPterm users unfamiliar with modems who have their
      CD settings wrong on their terminal (i.e., AT &C0).  The proper
      setting is AT &C1 ... for "true carrier detect" results.

     A new RIPTERM.PCX logo file has been included with this release.
      Some said that our prior logo screen wasn't adequate, so we made
      a new one.

     Added a new option to the pull-down menus:  VT-102 MODE.
      When in this mode, several keys on your keyboard react as if RIPterm
      were a VT-102 compatible keyboard.  When this mode is active, the
      following keys will transmit the indicated piece of text:

                              F1 ...  ESC [ M
                              F2 ...  ESC [ N
                              F3 ...  ESC [ O
                              F4 ...  ESC [ P
                              F5 ...  ESC [ Q
                              F6 ...  ESC [ R
                              F7 ...  ESC [ S
                              F8 ...  ESC [ T
                              F9 ...  ESC [ U
                             F10 ...  ESC [ V
                            PGUP ...  ESC [ I
                            PGDN ...  ESC [ G
                            HOME ...  ESC [ H
                             END ...  ESC [ F
                          INSERT ...  ESC [ L
                       CURSOR UP ...  ESC [ A
                       CURSOR DN ...  ESC [ B
                     CURSOR LEFT ...  ESC [ C
                    CURSOR RIGHT ...  ESC [ D

      In addition, many ANSI escape sequences function slightly differently
      than in normal ANSI mode.  When in this mode, RIPterm tries to act
      like a VT-102 compatible terminal.

     Made the "Offline" field in the status bar bring up the dialing
      directory, not the manual dialing dialog box.

     Resolved a bug with the Auto-Sensing RIPscrip option.  If the
      auto-sensing ANSI command was received and the cursor was still
      in column #1, it would not respond with any return sequence.

     Resolved a bug with the Hangup command which would apparently
      freeze-up RIPterm, but in fact, was actually taking an abnormally
      long time to disconnect (roughly 1800 seconds).

     Modified RIPterm so that RTS/CTS is by default, "ON".  Hardware
      flow control of modem data is critically important in a graphical
      terminal so that data is not lost while graphics commands are
      being executed.  If CTS is "low", then this mode is automatically
      disabled for you.

     Resolved a bug with the "Restore Mouse Fields" text variable and
      the "local RIP playback" variable when used in Mouse Fields or
      Buttons.  This would cause the Host Command string to be improperly
      processed.

                  Version 1.50.00 ... Released 02/15/93                     
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸

     This is a very major new release with a great many enhancements and
     other features that were not present in prior versions.  The
     following is a summary of what's new in v1.50.00:

       RIPterm no longer requires a Mouse!

       You can now access the pull-down menus via the keyboard by
        hitting the F10 key.  You may navigate through the menus
        with the arrow keys and tapping <ENTER> on the desired item
        to activate it.

       You may now access ANY mouse field in a RIPscrip menu
        without the mouse by using the TAB or SHIFT-TAB keys to
        hilight the field you want to execute.  Once the desired
        field is hilighted, simply tap the <ENTER> key to activate
        the mouse field.  If you wish to un-hilight any mouse field,
        simply tap the Escape key.

       System Font ability (change your Text fonts).  This mode
        allows you to choose what size text you wish to use under
        normal text environments.  You have five separate Fonts to
        choose from:

             80x43 (default)
             80x25 (normal DOS screen size)
             40x25 (low-res font)
             91x43 (get more columns of text at once)
             91x25 (get more columns of text at once)

         This new "System Fonts" ability allows you to custom tailor
         how RIPterm will display normal text to you when in a full-
         screen text mode interface.  The BBS can overide this mode
         under circumstances where your text interface is not full-
         screen.  Whenever your screen is "reset" by the BBS (i.e.,
         it is zoomed to full-screen mode), your default System Font
         will once again be re-activated.

       Built-in text variable system for Keystroke Macros, amd for
        BBS/RIPterm information exchange.  This mode allows RIPterm
        to become intelligent.  It does this by storing information
        in a local database file (RIPTERM.DB) for future retrieval.
        Every piece of information that is stored in this database
        file is associated with a text variabe "name".  Each name
        is from 3-12 characters in length.  The data that is
        associated with the text variable can be from 0-60 characters
        in length.  Any data that is stored in the database file is
        saved indefinitely until either you, or the BBS alters it in
        some way.  For high-speed retrieval of text variable data,
        the database is automatically indexed for you.  An index is
        like "sorting" something alphabetically so that you can find
        a piece of information quickly.  In the event that the index
        becomes corrupt due to loss of power or something of that
        nature, RIPterm will automatically re-build the index file
        for you.  See the section of the RIPterm documentation on
        Text Variables in Keystroke Macros for many new details about
        how to take advantage of this powerful feature.

       A new "pull-down" menu has been added (DATA).  Under this
        menu, you can create (or modify) text variables, view the
        contents of "pre-defined" text variables (e.g., $DATE$,
        $TIME$, etc).  Also, you can view the contents of your
        Text Variable database.

       Popup List ability in keystroke macros.  Allow your keystroke
        macros to do different things depending on a choice you make
        when you execute the macro.  Pop-up lists are easy to create
        and can be extremely useful when you need a macro to apply
        to more than one type of situation online.

       Doorway mode for Marshall Dudley's DOORWAY access program.
        Just type ALT-= (alt-equal sign) to enter doorway mode. 
        When in this mode, any special keystrokes you type are sent
        to the BBS in a special way that any "doorway compatible"
        package can use.  In this mode, the BBS can actually take
        advantage of ALT keys, Function keys, Arrow Keys, or various
        other keystrokes.  Only BBS software that directly supports
        Doorway Mode can take advantage of this feature.  This mode
        is predominantly used when accessing "Door" features of many
        popular BBS packages (like PC-Board, Wildcat, Synchronet BBS,
        and many others).

       Support for a 101-key enhanced AT-keyboard in Doorway Mode.
        Do not use this option if you do not have a 101-key keyboard.
        If RIPterm freezes up on you when you go into this mode, 
        reboot your computer and run RIPterm with the -E parameter to
        disable 101-key support (i.e., RIPTERM -E).

       RIPterm now auto-senses if a connection exists when you run
        the software.  If a connection already exists, RIPterm does
        not send the modem initialization string, but simply taps
        <ENTER> to the BBS to (ideally) re-display the current menu,
        or at least some kind of prompt.

       RIPterm can auto-sense RIPscrip with the ANSI sequence
        <ESC>[! ... it will return "RIPSCRIP015005" (the RIPscrip
        version number, i.e., "v01.50.05").  This will only occur
        if the BBS you call can support RIPscrip "auto-sensing".

       A new boot-up mode (/O) to say you're already online.

       Completely rewritten text-scrolling code!  Scrolling
        text is approximately 10 times faster than in prior versions
        of RIPterm.  Callers at 2400 baud will notice that scrolling
        is faster than the modem.  Higher speed callers will still
        notice that scrolling isn't as fast in a text-mode terminal
        program, but that the scrolling is still much MUCH faster.
        Scrolling speed is now limited by the speed of your computer,
        and the type of Video Board you have.  16-bit video cards will
        have faster scrolling than 8-bit cards.  We can't get much
        faster with the scrolling speed, due to hardware performance
        issues.  Future versions of RIPterm could very well auto-detect
        your video card, and if you have an accelerated VGA card, it
        might be able to improve performance still further.

       Re-engineered File Transfer Protocols.  You now have access
        to the following protocols:
      
                 Xmodem (checksum)       Xmodem (CRC)
                 Xmodem-1K               Xmodem-1K (G)
                 Ymodem (batch)          Ymodem-G
                 Zmodem                  Kermit
                 ASCII
                 
           NOTE: Zmodem now supports crash recovery
      
       File transfer protocols now check to see if the connection
        with the BBS has been lost.  If so, it aborts the transfer.

       File transfer protocols now allow you to abort a transfer by
        tapping the <ESC> key.

       Better support for flow control handshaking.  RTS/CTS
        support has been added for better high-speed performance.
        Also, XON/XOFF flow control options are enhanced for more
        reliable operation.  Use RTS/CTS flow control with high-
        speed modems for the best performance of your modem.

       Baud Rates up to 115,200 are now supported.  4800 baud
        now exists as a choice too.

       The Modem Options dialog box has been restructured to be
        less confusing, and more pleasing to the eye.

       Help system has been overhauled (type F1 to see).  You can
        now use the arrow keys to navigate through the Help System's
        keywords to hilight the desired keyword in the specified
        direction.  You no longer have to TAB endlessly through
        numerous keywords to get to the one you want.  Also, the
        Help Table of Contents has been totally re-designed to be
        easier to use.

       Scrolling up/down one line in the scollback buffer no
        longer trims spaces from the beginning of printed lines.
        This gives an accurate representation of what the text
        looked like.  Note that ANSI cursor movement commands can
        make the scrollback buffer look different than what you see
        on the screen.

       Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters are now
        handled properly.

       Cursor wrapping no longer occurs on column #80, but at column
        81.  This became evident with large ANSI pictures becoming
        screwed up due to premature Cursor wrapping.

       A complete dialing directory system has been added in this
        version of RIPterm.  You may have up to 100 separate systems
        in a particular dialing directory file (e.g., RIPTERM.PHO).
        You may have as many directory files as you wish.  The Dialing
        Directory has a great many features to make your life easier.
        See the section in RIPTERM.DOC on "Dialing Directories" for
        more information on the available features.

       The "Dialing Window" has been overhauled to display what
        system you are currently dialing.  In addition, you may alter
        the "Redial time" from within this window by clicking on the
        increment/decrement buttons next to the timer.  This allows
        you to increase or decrease the available redial timeout without
        having to edit your setup manually.  Also, a DELETE button has
        been added allowing you to remove an entry from the list of
        Systems you are dialing.  This would be useful if you were
        dialing several systems and you decide that you do not wish
        to dial one of the systems anymore.

       Ability to keep Icons in separate subdirectories for different
        systems.  Specify which system's icons go where in the
        dialing directory.  If you do not specify which sub-directory
        Icons will be stored in, the default ICONS\ sub-directory will
        be used.  If the BBS you are connected to instructs RIPterm to
        load an Icon, it will first check that system's directory.  If
        the Icon is not located there, it will check the ICONS\
        directory for the file.  This allows a BBS to "overide" default
        Icons with ones of their own design, thus preventing one BBS
        from over-writing Icons from another system inadvertantly.

       New command line options for specifying alternate Setup files,
        alternate dialing directory files, and to automatically dial
        an entry in the dialing directory upon bootup.  Type
        "RIPTERM ?" for more details or see RIPTERM.DOC for a more
        elaborate description on these features.

       Re-engineered internal memory management.  RIPterm now uses
        memory more efficiently than in previous versions.

       Auto Download feature for BBS'es that can take advantage of
        it.  This allows protocols like Xmodem to auto-download
        like Zmodem does.

       Zmodem auto-downloads will now "erase" the Zmodem transfer
        header before actually beginning the download.  

       New Block Protocol option - This is for use on RIPscrip
        BBS'es where an error-free transmission of Icons or RIP
        scenes is desired.  RIPterm accomplishes this transfer of
        information with its built-in file transfer protocols.

       Progress Indicator on any upload/download that supports
        Batch Transfer (i.e., Ymodem, Ymodem-G, Kermit and Zmodem).

       Option to use DTR to hangup the modem instead of the less
        efficient +++ ATH method.  If for some reason, DTR fails to
        hangup the modem, the normal +++ ATH method will be used to
        disconnect.  If the modem still has not terminated the
        connection, the message "Hangup Failed" will be displayed to
        alert you that you are still online.

       Support for many new ANSI escape code sequences (some VT-102
        and VT-52 features now supported).  The new ANSI codes
        processed are:
      
            Underline mode now supported in "display attributes"
            Blink mode now displays as BOLD (bright)
            Invert Video mode now acts properly
            Tab Stops are fully supported now
            Scrolling regions now supported
            Device Status Reports
            Extended Save/Restore cursor (ESC 7, ESC 8) added
            Reset Terminal Emulation command (ESC c)
            Device Attribute Report (ESC Z)
            Cursor UP/DOWN with scrolling (ESC D, ESC M, ESC E)
      
       DOS Shell mode spruced up a bit - now displays a modified
        DOS Prompt to indicate you are inside a DOS Shell.

       New Intro screen mode.  You may now view a .PCX file upon
        bootup in place of the standard logo screen.  If the file
        RIPTERM.PCX is present in your RIPterm directory, it will be
        loaded.  A Brief copyright message will be shown at the
        bottom of the screen.  .PCX logo files must be 16-color
        EGA images in a resolution of 640x350.  The Copyright
        Message is displayed from scan lines 300-349.

       A new RIPTERM.RES (resource) file is included with RIPterm.
        This file contains many of the frequently used graphical
        images that are used internally in RIPterm.  BBS Icons
        are NOT stored in this file.

       Local RIPscrip file playback ability.  The host can now
        transfer a .RIP file to your system, and then later on
        instruct your system to play it back locally.  Graphics
        playback is lightning fast in this mode.

       You can now automatically display a RIPscrip scene file 
        upon bootup of RIPterm if you wish.  Use the -R parameter
        when booting up RIPterm to execute a RIPscrip file.  For
        example, if you wanted to load RIPterm and display the
        RIPscrip file MYSCREEN.RIP, issue the folling command:

          ripterm -rMYSCREEN.RIP

        If you omit the .RIP extension, it will be added for you
        automatically.  .RIP files by default, are checked in the
        ICONS\ sub-directory.

       New option to disable Beeps has been added for situations
        where you want peace and quiet.

       Status Bar has been re-designed.  It is now shorter, thus
        allowing a full 80x24 screen when in certain System Font
        modes.  In addition, you can now "click" on fields in the
        status bar and the appropriate command will be executed.
        Some status bar fields do different things in different
        modes.  If you are Online somewhere, and you click on the
        "Online" field, it will ask you if you wish to Hangup.
        If you are Offline, and you click on "Offline", it will
        bring up the dialing directory automatically.  If you are
        currently logging a session to disk, the filename will be
        displayed on that Status Bar.  Clicking on this field will
        allow you to close the Log File.

       You may now "Pause" a log-file temporarily.

       Data Security mode has been added to prevent unauthorized
        queries from your local Database by Host Systems.  This
        mode was added so that as the user have control on what
        types of information a BBS can ask your terminal.

       You may now execute a local .RIP file from within a keystroke
        macro quickly and easily.  The .RIP file that is loaded will
        be located in whatever Icons sub-directory is designated for
        the system you are currently connected to.  If it cannot find
        the file in that directory, or you are not currently online,
        it will load the file from the ICONS\ sub-directory.

       You may now alter the Base-I/O address of your Serial Ports.
        This becomes quite useful in situations where you have an
        oddball Serial Port configuration where IRQ (interrupt)
        settings just won't cut it.  This is quite useful for things
        like DigiBoards, or other multi-port boards.  Consult your
        Serial Port card's documentation for details about various
        addresses it may use.

       A dialing directory conversion utility has been included with
        this release of RIPterm allowing you to convert Telix or
        TeleMate dialing directory files to RIPterm format.  This
        utility will auto-detect what type of directory file you 
        specify, and will convert the first 100 non-blank entries
        into the specified RIPterm directory file.  Both Telix and
        TeleMate allow up to 1000 entries in their dialing directory.
        RIPterm allows up to 100 entries.

     A number of changes were made in this first Beta revision.  Among
     those worth mentioning are:

       Support for the revised Mouse Region portion of the RIPscrip
        protocol.  It now has the ability to set the text window to
        full screen and clear the screen when a mouse region is
        clicked.  This provides for a simplified installation on a
        BBS that has many areas that cannot support RIPscrip.

       More Streamlined clickable buttons, simple dialog boxes and
        Information windows.  In all of these cases, the buttons on
        these windows are now "visibly" clickable and support default
        choices when <RETURN> is pressed.  In addition, tapping <ESC>
        at any of these menus now operates properly rather than 
        selecting "YES" all the time.

       The "Reset All Windows" RIPscrip command would not clear the
        last few scan lines of the graphics display.  This would
        occasionally leave remaining graphics data on the screen when
        it shouldn't be there.  Now fixed.

       When dialing the modem with the auto re-dialer, tapping a key
        would display a message in the message window in the incorrect
        font, size and color.  Now fixed.
